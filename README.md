  There many local companies in uzbekistan that I could have done a web site for, but as I am a director of an educational centre named "Knowledge Academy Group", I decided to do a web site for my own company. As for the educational center, the website needsÂ to have been incredibly informative so that visitors could get all the information they needed there. I started by creating the main website, where a visitor may learn more about the educational facility in general and sign up for any course with only one button. I also put a location, contacts information, and links to our social media profiles in the section at the bottom of the website known as the footer. The second thing I did was create a form that visitors could fill out and submit with their contact information so that the call center could get in touch with them. After that, I created a slider with photographs of the center's rooms so that guests could see the facility's inside.
